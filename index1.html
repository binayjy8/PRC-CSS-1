        <h1>Tiger</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of
             the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on 
             orange fur with a white underside. An apex predator, it primarily preys on
              ungulates, such as deer and wild boar.The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the

        <h3>Taxonomy</h3>
        <p>In 1758, Carl Linnaeus described the tiger in his work Systema Naturae and gave it the 
            scientific name Felis tigris.[2] In 1929, the British taxonomist Reginald Innes Pocock
             subordinated the species under the genus Panthera using the scientific name Panthera tigris.[8][9]</p>

        <h1>Evolution</h1>
        <p>The fossil species Panthera palaeosinensis of early Pleistocene northern China was described as a possible
             tiger ancestor when it was discovered in 1924, but modern cladistics place it as basal to modern Panthera.[38][36]
              Panthera zdanskyi, which lived around the same time and place, was suggested to be a sister taxon of the
               modern tiger when it was examined in 2014.[36] However, as of 2023, at least two recent studies considered P.
            zdanskyi likely to be a synonym of P. palaeosinensis, noting that its proposed differences from that species fell
             within the range of individual variation.[39][40] The earliest appearance of the modern tiger species in the fossil
              record are jaw fragments from Lantion in China that are dated to the early Pleistocene.[36] Middle to late Pleistocene 
              tiger fossils were found throughout China, Sumatra and Java. Prehistoric subspecies include Panthera tigris trinilensis 
              and P. t. soloensis of Java and Sumatra, and P. t. acutidens of China; late Pleistocene and early Holocene fossils of
               tigers were also found in Borneo and Palawan, Philippines.[41]</p>
